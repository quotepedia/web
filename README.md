## ðŸ“ƒ Prerequisites

To run the frontend at your local machine, install the following:

- [pnPm](https://pnpm.io/installation): Fast, disk space efficient package manager.

## ðŸ“¦ Building from source

To start, open a command prompt and follow these instructions:

### Step 1 â€” Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm i
```

### Step 2 â€” Configure the environment

Create `.env` file in the root directory with the following contents:

```properties
VITE_APP_NAME=$npm_package_name
VITE_APP_VERSION=$npm_package_version

VITE_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000/"

VITE_SESSION_SECRET="9aCbXMa1%pJcCMubS^HuprJ5YjS&#xY5"
VITE_SECURE_COOKIES=

## ðŸ›Ÿ FAQ

### Error | Uncaught Client Exception

Make sure `VITE_SECURE_COOKIES` is not set to `true` or you have a valid SSL (HTTPS) certificate.

### Error: Empty password

`VITE_SESSION_SECRET` Configuration option is not set. Make sure to re-read the [step 2](#step-2--configure-the-environment) and clear browser cookies.

> [!NOTE]
> You may also need to **re-build** the web app using `pnpm serve` or `pnpm build` to include newly configured options in `.env`.
