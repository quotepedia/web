## ðŸ“¦ Building

To start, open a command prompt and follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

To run this web app on your local machine, install the following:

- [pnPm](https://pnpm.io/installation): Fast, disk space efficient package manager.

### Step 1 â€” Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm i
```

### Step 2 â€” Configure the environment

Create `.env` file in the root directory with the following contents:

```properties

These settings are suitable for the most who want to run the app **locally**. Here's a more detailed and advanced explanation of each configuration option:

To run in production, you should export the `SESSION_SECRET` variable with your value:

```sh
EXPORT SESSION_SECRET=""
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can also browse all available configuration options [here](./src/global.d.ts).

### Step 3 â€” Run the app

To build and start the app, just execute the following command:

```sh
pnpm serve
```

The setup is done. Enjoy using this! ðŸŽ‰

### FAQ

#### Error | Uncaught Client Exception

Make sure `VITE_SECURE_COOKIES` is not set to `true` or you have a valid SSL (HTTPS) certificate.

#### Error: Empty password

`SESSION_SECRET` Configuration option is not set. Make sure to re-read the [step 2](#step-2--configure-the-environment) and clear browser cookies.

> [!NOTE]
> You may also need to **re-build** the web app using `pnpm serve` or `pnpm build` to include newly configured options in `.env`.
